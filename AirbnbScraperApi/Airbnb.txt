Comments:
Natascha’s place was wonderful! Design of the home was beautiful and cozy. The location was perfect for exploring Georgetown, but was also in a quiet area. Check-in and out was super easy and Natascha was very responsive. We hope to be back and would love to stay here again!
Amazing place to stay in Georgetown.
Fantastic place! Would stay here again in a heartbeat! Clean, well maintained, and was comfortable. Zero complaints!
I had a great stay at this airbnb! I was in town for an interview at Georgetown and this air bnb was perfect as I could easily walk to and from campus. It is located in a beautiful neighborhood and is a lovely 1 bedroom apartment. Natascha was very quick and responding to me and was flexible with my checkout time.
Thank you!

Julie is a wonderful host, her lovely apartment made my stay in Washington a one to remember. When I had any question she always nearly immediately answered and helped me. Hosts and places like hers are what makes traveling via Airbnb such a nice experience! Thank you!
Julie is an amazing host. She was very proactive, made sure I had all the instructions and tips days before I checked in, and was overall kind and accommodating to my needs.
5 stars across the board. Julie has been an amazing host, extremely responsive and flexible. The place is lovely and the location ideal. I’d come back again
This is one of the best Airbnb I have ever been to. I felt so safe and comfortable the entire time. Julie is so friendly and made me feel like right at home. She made sure to keep everything I could possibly ask for in the room. I will definitely stay at her place again on my next visit to D.C.
What an outstanding Airbnb experience. Julie was an incredibly gracious host. She went out of her way to accommodate my needs and made me feel so comfortable and welcome. The space was absolutely beautiful--even better than the pictures. I could have stayed in that shower all day. Every small convenience I could possibly need was there and ready for me. It made the space very livable. While this was a room in a home, it felt like an extremeIy private space. I was sad to leave!
